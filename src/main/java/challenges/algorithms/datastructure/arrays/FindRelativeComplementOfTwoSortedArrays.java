/**
 * Given two sorted arrays arr1 and arr2 of size m and n respectively. We need to find relative complement of
 * two array i.e, arr1 â€“ arr2 which means that we need to find all those elements which are present in arr1
 * but not in arr2.
 *
 * Input : arr1[] = {3, 6, 10, 12, 15}
 *         arr2[] = {1, 3, 5, 10, 16}
 * Output : 6 12 15
 * The elements 6, 12 and 15 are present
 * in arr[], but not present in arr2[]
 *
 * Input : arr1[] = {10, 20, 36, 59}
 *         arr2[] = {5, 10, 15, 59}
 * Output : 20 36
