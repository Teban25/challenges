 * 1.4.1 Show that the number of different triples that can be chosen from N items is
 * precisely N(N-1)(N-2)/6. Hint: Use mathematical induction.

	/*
	 * Solution:
	 *  * Given N items, for each item, there are (N-1) pairs that can be formed without reusing an item.
	 * Of the N(N-1) pairs, 1/2 will be repeats, e.g. (a,b) and (b,a), so 1/2 will be unique.
	 * Thus, there are N(N-1)/2 unique pairs.
	 * For each of the unique N(N-1)/2 pairs, there are (N-2) triplets that can be formed without reusing an item.
	 * Of the N(N-1)(N-2)/2 triplets, 2/3 will be repeats, e.g. ((a,b),c), ((a,c),b), and ((c,b),a), so 1/3 will be unique.
	 * Thus, there are N(N-1)(N-2)/6 unique triplets.
